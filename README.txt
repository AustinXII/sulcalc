 Giving credit where credit is due:
  * http://www.smogon.com/
    I found all of the articles on the site very useful. In
    particular, I would like to thank the writers of "The 
    Complete Damage Formula for Black & White". Thank you Xfr,
    Bond697, Kaphotics, and V4Victini, your article is amazing
    and I'm glad that I had it as a source.

    A big thanks to Peter O. of UPokeCenter. The attention you
    pay to the minute mechanics of every facet of the games
    served as a guideline for me throughout building the entire
    calculator.
  * http://mount-silver.proboards.com/
    Thank you Crystal_, Isa, Jorgen, and the Mt. Silver community
    for their input on some of the ambiguous mechanics of RBY and
    GSC, such as stat rollover and critical hits. Those were
    definitely some of the most convoluted mechanics I've seen.
  * In general I'd like to say thank you to the online Pokemon
    community. I've read innumerable forum posts and articles
    and I have likely forgotten to give credit to someone along
    the line. If you've posted an article online relating to the
    technical aspects of game mechanics, then I'm sure that I've
    read it and that it helped me build this program.
